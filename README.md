# School in the Cloud   
**Timeline**: One week  
**Tech**: HTML, CSS, React.js, Material UI  
**Description**: School in the Cloud is a platform that trains senior volunteers to teach students in a group or individual setting.  
**Contribution Type**: School Team Project - [Login form](https://github.com/RococoCoding/School-in-the-Clouds/blob/main/front-end/src/components/LoginForm.js), [Register form](https://github.com/RococoCoding/School-in-the-Clouds/blob/main/front-end/src/components/RegisterForm.js), [navbar](https://github.com/RococoCoding/School-in-the-Clouds/blob/main/front-end/src/components/NavBar.js)  
**Status**: Completed  
**Retrospective**: For my Unit 2 build week project, I was tasked with building the sign up and login forms. It was fairly straightforward, but I finished early, so I researched Material UI and styled the navbar using that as well. That was a good foray into independently reearching third-party tech, familiarizing myself with it and implementing it.

# front-end

// Here we will compile all code for the front end including all components and forms

// Three main contributors

// Create new branches each day and merge at the end of the day

// School in the Cloud will accomodate three types of users: admin, volunteers, and students

// The apps core functionalities will include login, registering, and the creation of tasks
